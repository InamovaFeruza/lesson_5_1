					Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan.
					It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael
					Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of
					astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.
				</div>
				<div class="section2">
					Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan
					developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production
					company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and
					2017 Nobel laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant,
					and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and
					Legendary Pictures co-financed the film.
				</div>
				<div class="section3">
					Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm.
					Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar
					uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital
					effects.
				</div>
				<div class="section4">
					Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was
					first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide
					gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent re-releases), making it the
					tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar received positive reviews for its screenplay,
					direction, themes, visual effects, musical score, acting, and ambition. At the 87th Academy Awards, the
					film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound
					Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design.

				<div class="section5">
					In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Cooper, a widowed engineer and former
					NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, his 15-year-old son, Tom, and 10-year-old
					daughter, Murphy "Murph". After a dust storm, patterns inexplicably appear in the dust covering Murphy's
					bedroom, which she thinks is the work of a ghost. Cooper deduces the patterns were caused by gravity
					variations and they represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a
					secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand.
				</div>
				<div class="section6">
					There he learns that 48 years earlier, unknown beings placed a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a
					distant galaxy with 12 potentially habitable worlds located near a supermassive black hole named
					Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to survey the planets and three — Dr. Mann,
					Laura Miller, and Wolf Edmunds — reported positive results. Professor Brand reveals two plans to ensure
					humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing an anti-gravitational propulsion theory to propel
					settlements into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen
					human embryos to settle a habitable planet.
				</div>
				<div class="section7">
					Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murphy his
					wristwatch to compare their relative time for when he returns. After traversing the wormhole, Dr. Romilly
					studies the black hole while Cooper, Dr. Doyle, and Dr. Amelia Brand descend in a landing craft to
					investigate Miller's planet, an ocean world covered in water. They find wreckage of Miller's ship before
					Doyle is killed by a gigantic wave. Cooper and Brand return to Endurance and find, due to Gargantua's
					proximity, time is severely dilated: 23 years have elapsed for Romilly and for those on Earth.
				</div>
				<div class="section8">
					Cooper decides to use their remaining fuel to reach Mann's planet, where they revive him from cryostasis.
					Meanwhile, Murphy, now a scientist working with NASA, transmits a message announcing Professor Brand has
					died. She has learned that Plan A, which required unattainable data from within a black hole, was never
					viable. Murphy accuses Brand and Cooper of knowing that those left on Earth were doomed. Cooper
					subsequently declares that he will be returning to Earth while Brand and Romilly will remain on Mann's
					planet for permanent habitation. While Mann and Cooper explore the planet, Mann reveals that the planet
					is uninhabitable; he had sent falsified data to be rescued and attempts to kill Cooper. He then takes a
					lander and heads for Endurance. Romilly is killed by a booby trap left by Mann. Brand and Cooper chase
					Mann in another lander before he dies during a failed docking operation, severely damaging Endurance.
					After a difficult docking manoeuver, Cooper regains control.
				</div>
				<div class="section9">
					With insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, they use a slingshot maneuver so close to Gargantua that
					time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and robot TARS jettison themselves to shed
					weight and propel Endurance to ensure it reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the event horizon of
					Gargantua, they eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive three-dimensional
					structure called the tesseract, which is located far from the singularity. Across different time periods,
					Cooper sees through the bookcases of Murph's old room, weakly interacting with its gravity and realizing
					that he was Murphy's "ghost".
				</div>
				<div class="section10">
					Speculating that the tesseract was constructed by humanity's far-future descendants who can provide
					access to infinite time and space but cannot communicate through it themselves, Cooper realizes they have
					been brought there to relay information critical to humanity's survival to Murph. Cooper uses
					gravitational waves to encode NASA's co-ordinates in the dust patterns in Murphy’s room before
					manipulating the second hand of Murph's wristwatch, using Morse code to transmit data collected by TARS
					from within Gargantua. On Earth, Murphy realizes the "ghost" is her father and deciphers the Morse code.

				</div>
				<div class="section11">
					Ejected from the tesseract, Cooper is picked up and awakens on a space habitat orbiting Saturn, where he
					reunites with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy successfully
					solved the gravitational theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's mass exodus and transformation into an
					advanced spacefaring civilisation. Nearing death and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return
					to Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to fly to Edmunds' planet, where Brand, having discovered and
					buried the deceased Edmunds, has begun to build a base for Plan B.

				<div class="section12">
					The premise for Interstellar was conceived by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne,
					who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a
					blind date.[5][6] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in
					the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans," and attracted filmmaker Steven Spielberg's interest
					in directing.[7] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced
					plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was
					attached to produce.[8][9] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[10]
